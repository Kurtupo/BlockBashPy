This is my high school Intro to Programming final project.
This is meant to be a clone of Puzzle League / Tetris Attack with my own twists!

Shout-outs to these people, whose hard work and effort I'm basically stealing:

alexirpan - My entire game is based offf of this guy's code.
https://github.com/alexirpan/Tetris-Attack

ppizarror - This menu template is sooo good.
https://github.com/ppizarror/pygame-menu

Nintendo - I'm literally stealing their game and music.

Changelog
--- v0.4 --- "First Impressions"
- Published this on the internet for the first time
- Current menu using tkinter. Will change this to use ppizarror's menu

Known Issues:
- Whenever a row is spawned, the first two completely changed.
	+ This is probably because I messed with something and forgot to change it. Some cross-reference to the original will fix it.
	+ Noted: v0.4

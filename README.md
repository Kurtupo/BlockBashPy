This is my high school Intro to Programming final project.
This is meant to be a clone of Puzzle League / Tetris Attack with my own twists!

Shout-outs to these people, whose hard work and effort I'm basically stealing:

alexirpan - My entire game is based offf of this guy's code.

ppizarror - This menu template is sooo good.

Nintendo - I'm literally stealing their game and music.

Changelog
-- v1.0 -- "Stable Release"
- Revised menu
- Game now has an intro cutscene to give nonsensical context to the game
- Game now has animated characters
- Bugs are now features

-- v0.6 -- "Menu Madness"
- Implemented ppizarror's menu template
- Menu has music, sounds, and is aesthetically... well, it's pretty okay, I guess.
- Commented on most of the code so that you can make fun of me not knowing how code works :p
- Cleaned up code so that it doesn't look like an absolute mess

--- v0.4 --- "First Impressions"
- Published this on the internet for the first time
- Current menu using tkinter. Will change this to use ppizarror's menu

Known Issues:
- Whenever a row is spawned, the bottom two completely change
	+ This is probably because I messed with something and forgot to change it. Some cross-reference to the original should fix it.
	+ Noted: v0.4
	+ Solved: v1.0 - Is now a feature
